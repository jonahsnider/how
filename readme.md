Learn how to use CLI apps.

## Usage

Install using your favorite Node.js package manager:

```sh
npm i -g how-cli
yarn global add how-cli
pnpm i -g add how-cli
```

You can also use `npx` when in a pinch, but a global install is preferred:

```sh
npx how-cli <app>
pnpx how-cli <app>
```

A common-ish CPU & OS as well as a recent version of Node.js (something that can run modules natively) are required to run how.
Your package manager should prevent you from installing how if your system is incompatible.

```sh
how <app>
```

### Example

Learn how to use `tar`:

```sh
how tar
```
